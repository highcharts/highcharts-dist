     * (Highmaps) A tiledwebmap series allows user to display dynamically joined
     * individual images (tiles) and join them together to create a map.
     *
     * Configuration options for the series are given in three levels:
     *
     * 1. Options for all series in a chart are defined in the
     * plotOptions.series object.
     *
     * 2. Options for all `tiledwebmap` series are defined in
     * plotOptions.tiledwebmap.
     *
     * 3. Options for one single series are given in the series instance array.
     * (see online documentation for example)
     *
     * **TypeScript:**
     *
     * - the type option must always be set.
     *
     * - when accessing an array of series, the combined set of all series types
     * is represented by Highcharts.SeriesOptionsType . Narrowing down to the
     * specific type can be done by checking the `type` property. (see online
     * documentation for example)
