         * (Highstock) An array of data points for the series. For the `renko`
         * series type, points can be given in the following ways:
         *
         * 1. An array of arrays with 1 or 2 values correspond to `x,close`. If
         * the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of the point,
         * and the `x` value is inferred. The `x` value can also be omitted, in
         * which case the inner arrays should be of length 4. Then the `x` value
         * is automatically calculated, either starting at 0 and incremented by
         * 1, or from `pointStart` and `pointInterval` given in the series
         * options. (see online documentation for example)
         *
         * 2. An array of objects with named values. With renko series, the data
         * does not directly correspond to the points in the series. the reason
         * is that the points are calculated based on the trends and boxSize.
         * Setting options for individual point is impossible. (see online
         * documentation for example)
