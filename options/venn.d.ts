         *
         * 1) `grid` - grid-based clustering technique. Points are assigned to
         * squares of set size depending on their position on the plot area.
         * Points inside the grid square are combined into a cluster. The grid
         * size can be controlled by `gridSize` property (grid size changes at
         * certain zoom levels).
         *
         * 2) `kmeans` - based on K-Means clustering technique. In the first
         * step, points are divided using the grid method (distance property is
         * a grid size) to find the initial amount of clusters. Next, each point
         * is classified by computing the distance between each cluster center
         * and that point. When the closest cluster distance is lower than
         * distance property set by a user the point is added to this cluster
         * otherwise is classified as `noise`. The algorithm is repeated until
         * each cluster center not change its previous position more than one
         * pixel. This technique is more accurate but also more time consuming
         * than the `grid` algorithm, especially for big datasets.
         *
         * 3) `optimizedKmeans` - based on K-Means clustering technique. This
         * algorithm uses k-means algorithm only on the chart initialization or
         * when chart extremes have greater range than on initialization. When a
         * chart is redrawn the algorithm checks only clustered points distance
         * from the cluster center and rebuild it when the point is spaced
         * enough to be outside the cluster. It provides performance improvement
         * and more stable clusters position yet can be used rather on small and
         * sparse datasets.
         *
         * By default, the algorithm depends on visible quantity of points and
         * `kmeansThreshold`. When there are more visible points than the
         * `kmeansThreshold` the `grid` algorithm is used, otherwise `kmeans`.
         *
         * The custom clustering algorithm can be added by assigning a callback
         * function as the type property. This function takes an array of
         * `processedXData`, `processedYData`, `processedXData` indexes and
         * `layoutAlgorithm` options as arguments and should return an object
         * with grouped data.
         *
         * The algorithm should return an object like that: (see online
         * documentation for example)
         *
         * `clusterId` (example above - unique id of a cluster or noise) is an
         * array of points belonging to a cluster. If the array has only one
         * point or fewer points than set in `cluster.minimumClusterSize` it
         * won't be combined into a cluster.
